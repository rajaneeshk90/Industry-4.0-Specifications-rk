## Introduction

Industry 4.0, often referred to as smart manufacturing, signifies the profound digital transformation of the manufacturing sector. This transformation is marked by a drive towards enhanced productivity, agility, flexibility, and real-time decision-making. It is underpinned by the integration of cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, analytics, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), into manufacturing operations. The result is the emergence of "smart factories," equipped with robots, embedded software, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and sophisticated sensors that collect and analyse data to enhance decision-making.

This digital revolution facilitates the breakdown of information silos by integrating data from various areas such as customer service, supply chain, and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). The outcomes include increased automation, predictive maintenance, process enhancements, and higher levels of efficiency and responsiveness to customer demands. Real-time visibility of manufacturing assets, made possible by sensor data on the factory floor, aids in predictive maintenance and reduces equipment downtime. The deployment of high-tech IoT devices in smart factories enhances output and product quality. Additionally, AI-powered visual insights reduce production errors, resulting in cost and time savings.
